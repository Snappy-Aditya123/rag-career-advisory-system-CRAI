# CareerSense AI  
## A Retrieval-Augmented Career Advisory System

## Abstract
CareerSense AI is a document-grounded career advisory system that applies retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and agent-based large language model (LLM) workflows to provide personalised career guidance. The system evaluates user CVs, extracts structured insights, and conditions downstream career advice on both the CV content and retrieved external knowledge from a vector database.

This project is developed as an exploratory and applied study of LLM grounding, document-aware reasoning, and practical RAG system design.

## Problem Statement
Generic LLM-based career advice often lacks personalisation and grounding, resulting in vague or hallucinated recommendations. CareerSense AI addresses this limitation by:

- Conditioning generation on user-specific documents (CVs)
- Incorporating retrieval from a vector database to ground responses
- Separating evaluation and advisory stages using agent-style workflows

---

## System Overview

The system operates in three primary stages:

1. **CV Evaluation**
   - The user uploads a CV.
   - The system parses and analyses the document using an LLM.
   - A structured evaluation is produced based on predefined criteria.

2. **Context Retrieval**
   - Relevant documents are retrieved from a vector database using semantic similarity.
   - Retrieved context is used to ground subsequent responses.

3. **Career Advisory**
   - An LLM generates career advice conditioned on:
     - The evaluated CV
     - Retrieved contextual documents
   - This improves relevance and reduces hallucination.

## Core Features

### CV Evaluation Agent
- Accepts CVs in PDF or text format
- Extracts structured information from unstructured documents
- Provides qualitative feedback on CV quality
- Identifies strengths, weaknesses, and improvement areas

### CV-Aware Career Advisor
- Interactive chatbot interface
- Uses retrieval-augmented generation
- Grounds responses in both CV content and external knowledge
- Produces context-aware career guidance

---

## Architecture

- **Frontend:** Streamlit
- **Backend:** Python
- **LLM Orchestration:** LangChain
- **LLM Inference:** Ollama (local models)
- **Vector Store:** LangChain-compatible vector database
- **Paradigm:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

The system is designed to be modular, enabling future extensions such as new agents, additional retrieval sources, or alternative LLM backends.

---

## Current Status

- CV ingestion and evaluation implemented
- Retrieval-augmented chatbot functional
- Local LLM inference via Ollama
- Ongoing development and refinement

---

## Planned Extensions

- **Job Market Integration**
  - Integration with the Reed.co.uk API to retrieve live job postings
  - Tailored recommendations based on real-time listings

- **External Knowledge Sources**
  - Integration with news and labour market APIs
  - Improved awareness of industry trends

- **Retrieval Improvements**
  - Expansion of the vector database
  - Improved chunking and embedding strategies

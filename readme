# CareerSense AI
**A CV-Aware Career Advisory Platform (RAG-Based)**

## Overview

CareerSense AI is a modular career advisory system that enables applications to provide **personalised, CV-aware career guidance**. It grounds large language model (LLM) responses in user-uploaded CVs and external knowledge sources using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

The project is intended to be used **as a foundation for real applications**, such as career coaching tools, HR platforms, or AI assistants.

## What This Solves

Most LLM-based career tools generate generic advice because they lack access to user-specific context. CareerSense AI addresses this by:

- Conditioning responses on uploaded CVs
- Grounding advice using semantic retrieval
- Separating CV analysis from advisory generation

This results in more relevant, structured, and actionable guidance.

## How It Works

The system operates in three stages:

1. **CV Ingestion & Analysis**
   - Users upload a CV (PDF or text)
   - The CV is parsed and analysed by an LLM
   - Key information and feedback are extracted in structured form

2. **Context Retrieval**
   - Relevant documents are retrieved from a vector database
   - Retrieval is based on semantic similarity

3. **Career Advisory**
   - An LLM generates career guidance conditioned on:
     - CV-derived insights
     - Retrieved contextual documents
